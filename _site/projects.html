<h2 id='window_state_management_component'>Window state management component</h2>

<h3 id='requirements'>Requirements</h3>

<p>Design a state management component for a multi-window application.</p>

<p>Each window provides an interface to browse business objects and perform operations on them.</p>

<p>The window state determines the operation to be performed, for instance in the ‘Add’ state the current entity is persisted.</p>

<h3 id='design_choices'>Design choices</h3>

<p>The architecture used in this project is MVC.</p>

<p>The underlying idea is to abstract the windows behaviour in terms of states from its concrete implementation, this is achieved as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>a state machine (see diagram) models the high-level window behaviour and exposes events that are fired on a state transition.</li>

<li>the window class has a dependency on the interface implemented by concrete state machines. It does not manipulate its dependency directly but provides it to a third party (a window controller, see below) that will in turn use it.</li>

<li>a window controller translates window widget events into state machine transitions and handles events raised by a state machine by modifying the state of the widgets of a specific window instance.</li>
</ol>

<p>A concrete example of how this solution works is the following</p>

<ol>
<li>a new instance of a window is created, a new instance of a state machine is passed as a dependency</li>

<li>the browse button of a window instance is clicked (e.g. ‘browseButtonClicked’)</li>

<li>the corresponding event is handled by the corresponding window controller method</li>

<li>this method retrieves the state machine instance from the window instance that raised the event and calls the corresponding transition.</li>

<li>depending on its state, the state machine instance raises a specific event</li>

<li>this event is in turn handled by the window controller that implements at a lower level of abstraction by manipulating window widgets directly.</li>
</ol>

<p>A distinct advantage of this approach is the loose coupling between the components (design by contract + dependency injection) and the separation of responsibilities (state machine defines high-level behaviour, controller translates low-level widget events into state machine behaviour and implements it by manipulating widgets, view generates low-level events and holds a reference to its state) .</p>

<h3 id='diagram_key'>Diagram Key</h3>

<p>Each node represents a window state</p>

<p>Each edge label represents a state machine action</p>

<p>The semantic of each state is defined as follows:</p>

<p>Add state: new record data can be supplied</p>

<p>Ok state: current (unedited) record data is displayed</p>

<p>Update state: current record data has been modified</p>

<p>warn states: a warning has been issued to the user, it can either be dismissed therefore completing the action or it can be confirmed thus cancelling the requested action.</p>

<p>The state machine diagram can be found in the corrisponding section.</p>
